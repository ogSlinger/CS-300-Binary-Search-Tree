**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

For these projects, a problem was given to the students to select a data structure to store elements of a CSV or text file. For the first project, a hash table was used and, for the second project, a binary search tree was made.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

The way I went about learning about these data structures was through visualization of the general concept, first. Then, when working on each part of the program, I iteratively worked on each component. Those elements were: populating 
the data structure, printing it's contents, and making sure memory management was implemented through the destructor. I find the knowledge of the performance of these data structures, with their space and time complexities, can 
help attain a fitting solution to whatever problem you are working on as a software engineer.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

For the most part, working on the code iteratively helped immensely. I know of some of the basic debugging techniques like commenting out code, or even throwing in std::cout statements to figure out where in the code I may have gotten 
to before the code broke. For example, I used a std::cout statement and moved it between different while loops because I noticed I was hanging in an infinitely somewhere in the code.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I will be taking the concepts of this class and applying it to how I handle data, especially on a larger scale. I plan on getting into systems development for VR/AR and being able to understand these concepts where performance is 
a top priority will help me greatly.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Overall, writing each of these projects allowed for me to organize my code for portability. By having the data structures in their own class, with nodes that hold the data, makes for easy implementation. However, by expanding on the 
functionality of the class, can it be a solution that can be applied all across a singular project, as opposed to having to rewrite it multiple times in the same project to fit the needs of something else.
